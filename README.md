# Hotwire Phoenix Demo: Chat

This is a [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) port of [hotwired/hotwire-rails-demo-chat](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-rails-demo-chat).

The original demo uses [turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails), but this demo implements the part in application because I am not sure turbo-rails' way fits in Phoenix for now.

In the near future I would try to extract pattern as a Hex package.

## To start this application:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
